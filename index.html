        <p>The day started off when we got off the plane. At that point, I couldn't believe how nice Euphoria looked. There was technology everywhere, and everything waas so natural. We then took a tour of the main area, and afterwards we took a hike on Mount Euphoria, the mountain that this country was named after. At the peak, we stopped. The tour guide told us the never-told story about this place.<em>"Long ago, the world was full of war. There was corruption everywhere, and many people were forced out of their homes as they were becoming poor. Then one day, five groups of refugees from all the continents met eachother on the sacred Mount Euphoria."</em>The tour guide stopped there and said that he would continue the next week.</p>

        <p>After we woke up the next day, we went to the city square. Everyone was so nice, and it was gleaming technology. We saw the towers that they built for all of their utilities, as well as the Maka, the tallest building in the country. I can't write anymore, but I will write tommorow</p>
